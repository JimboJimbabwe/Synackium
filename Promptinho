Here's a suggested prompt:
"I need you to create a detailed testing guide for ASVS requirements that I'll provide. For each requirement, generate a structured output that breaks down the testing methodology in detail. Here's how I'd like the information organized:
Please structure each response like this:
jsonCopy{
  "asvs_id": "string",
  "title": "string",
  "test_objective": "string (detailed explanation of what we're testing)",
  "security_rationale": "string (why this test matters for security)",
  "test_steps": [
    {
      "step_number": "integer",
      "automated": "boolean",
      "tool_name": "string or null",
      "technique": {
        "description": "string (detailed explanation of the testing technique)",
        "methodology": "string (how to perform the test)",
        "command": "string or null (exact command if applicable)"
      },
      "validation": {
        "pass_indicators": [
          {
            "description": "string",
            "example": "string (example output)",
            "explanation": "string (why this indicates a pass)"
          }
        ],
        "fail_indicators": [
          {
            "description": "string",
            "example": "string (example output)",
            "explanation": "string (why this indicates a fail)"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ],
  "documentation_requirements": [
    "string (what to document)",
    "string (how to document it)"
  ]
}
For each test step:

Provide specific tool usage justification
Include actual commands where applicable
Detail what constitutes a pass/fail
Give example outputs for both pass and fail scenarios
Explain why certain indicators represent pass/fail conditions

Example requirements will be provided in this format:
V{chapter}.{section}.{requirement} - Requirement text
Please ensure each response:

Is technically accurate and practical
Includes specific command syntax where tools are used
Explains both the 'what' and 'why' of each test step
Provides clear success/failure criteria
Includes example outputs"
