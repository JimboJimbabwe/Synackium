We have a hypothesis here that, certain domains reveal certain things, therefore we target the subset of resolved domains first
Because we could do all at once - see below

Basically man, you can't just assume seeing every IP as an IP that is worthy
Test the IPs that tell you something first, then everything else

THEN if nothing comes from a special service scan, do nmap -Pn -sV

Run 1NMAPSonic.py
  Yield: IP, Maybe DNS Reso, Ports, Services

Utilize Software Versioning Commands from jsons like /HOSTCONTACT or in /HostOperations

Make Python script to lever ServiceProbe1.file, ServiceProbe2.file, serviceprobelow.file (all json, playa)
Make Service probes for items in PopularRevProxies.json, reverseProxy1-2.json files

Hypo(Run ServiceProbeScanner.py)
  - Reads: IP, Ports, values from 
      ServiceProbe1.file, ServiceProbe2.file, serviceprobelow.file
      Service probes for items in PopularRevProxies.json, reverseProxy1-2.json
  - Sends service probes in jsons read to services that match the Ports in the given JSON Item of the IP in iteration

This will be deprecated. Soon
