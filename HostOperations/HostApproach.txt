Find a way to get the DNS resolution to the JSON file
Hostname: <NAME> OR <NONE>
Host Up: <YES/NO> OR <INCONCLUSIVE>
Take list json and process new refined list for review
Make scanner to scan for common subdomains
File.
Mail.
Server.

Operational Security
Ensure ability to weigh scopes with scope weigher
When you get the refined list, and go back to testing it, you will always download the target scope list
That list, will weigh itself against the JSON list. If there are no conflicting IPs in regards to the list from scope then the test will continue.
